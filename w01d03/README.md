# W01D03 - Objects in JS

### To Do
- [x] Review primitive types
- [x] Objects!
- [x] Passing primitives and objects to functions
- [x] Functions inside objects (using `this`)
- [x] Object iteration with `for..in`

### Primitives
* they are stored directly in memory
* they are immutable - can't be changed once set

* undefined
* null
* boolean
* string
* number

* symbol
* bigint

### Objects
* collections of key/value pairs
* hash, dictionary, associative array

const name = 'alice';



Use for..of with everything except objects, because Of and Object both start with 'O'
